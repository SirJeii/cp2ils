    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Sky -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a top navigation bar to switch between two main views: 'Timeline' and 'Projects'. The 'Timeline' view will present the project phases chronologically. The 'Projects' view will display a grid of all 13 project groups. Clicking a project card will dynamically display its full details in a modal-like overlay or a dedicated content pane on the right. This structure is chosen for usability because it allows users (students/teachers) to either get a high-level overview of the schedule or dive deep into a specific project's requirements without scrolling through a long, linear document. This separation of concerns (schedule vs. project details) makes information retrieval faster and more intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core information is textual and structural. The timeline will be represented using a styled list (HTML/CSS) to show chronological flow (Goal: Change). Project groups will be a grid of interactive cards (HTML/CSS + JS, Goal: Organize/Inform), which on click reveals detailed text blocks (HTML/CSS + JS, Goal: Inform). The interaction (click to reveal) simplifies the UI, preventing information overload. This is more effective than a static document as it allows users to focus only on the information relevant to them at that moment. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
